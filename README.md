# How to Make a Hit: The Music of Today for the Listening of Tomorrow
---
## Overview
Our project involves using data compiled from the music application Spotify and will focus on analyzing what song features can be isolated and configured to predict the popularity of a given record. Using Machine learning we manipulate features such are tempo, loudness, danceability, etc., to scale our song lists against their popularity scores. All values have been computed and assigned by Spotify. Our data comes from two sources: our training data will come from a data set compiling a songs ranging from 1921-2020; and our testing data will come from the top 100 songs per year from 2010-2019.
